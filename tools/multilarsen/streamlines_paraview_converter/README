The OCTAVE scripts in this folder convert paraview-exported streamlines to 
MULTILARSEN-intelligible stremlines.
The scripts should work with MATLAB as well.

1) Run the MAIN_all_streamlines_export.m script. This reads a paraview-exported file and
   shows you how it would like to export streamlines.
   - If you like it, type Y and enter. It will write streamlines in the 
     exported_streamlines directory
   - If you don't like it, type N. Modify the parameters in the script as you prefer.

2) Now run the octaStreamlineConverterInterp.m script. Long name, huh? :-)
   This will convert streamlines in the MULTILARSEN format.
   Streamlines will be placed in the output_streamlines folder.
   Inside the script you'll have to change a couple of parameters to tell which 
   streamlines you want to process.

3) IT'S POSSIBLE THAT STREAMLINES ARE UPSIDE-DOWN (maybe paraview exported them from the
   one with highest y to the one with lowest y). In this case, manually rename the files
   in the desired order.
   ALSO NOTE THAT you may see streamlines starting not from 00000. You may find the 
   reason for that in some settings in the MAIN_all_streamlines_export.m file.
