This testcase takes a solution of the Euler equations, obtained 
with the stagnation-line code "Stagline", and recomputes it using LARSEN.

The mixture is air5, with one Temperature (T = Tr = Tv = Tel = Te).

TO RUN THE TESTCASE, JUST RUN "./run_testcase.sh"

LARSEN is asked to use the very same mixture model (air5) and thermal
model (1T).
Diffusion of mass and energy is zero (Euler equations): the particle is 
adiabatic.

This testcase is a simulation of a sphere with velocity 9km/s at an altitude 
of around 60km.
See the file "stagline_input_file" for the freestream conditions.

LARSEN notably gets crazy very close to the stagnation point, since the 
velocity goes to zero.

If you find (small) mismatches with respect to the reference result figures, it may
be due to a different version of the thermodinamic library that you are using
(note: see [1]).

In the "mutation++_files" folder you can also find the "air5.xml" mixture file
and the "air5mechanism.xml" reactions file that were used to run this simulation.


==========
NOTES

[1] For example, seems like there is a wrong value in the air5 (and air11 maybe)
    reaction mechanism file, not really matching the Park01 rates.
    This may still be the case in your implementation, or may not.
    If your new Mutation++ implementation still has this error, contact the
    Mutation++ developers.
