This testcase compares the current LARSEN implementation with the output of 
the old C++ version of Shocking written by Pierre Schrooyen in 2014.

The mixture is air11, 1 temperature (T = Tr = Tv = Tel = Te).

TO RUN THE TESTCASE, SIMPLY RUN "./run_testcase"

The testcase gives to LARSEN the old Shocking result and asks LARSEN to 
recompute the same thing (same mixture, same chemical model).


NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THE NAMES ARE SIMILAR, THIS TESTCASE IS FUNDAMENTALLY 
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT YOU CAN FIND IN THE FOLDER shock_1D_air11_TTv!

This testcase computes a solution with the brODErs++ version of Shocking++
and tries to reproduce it using LARSEN.
The idea is checking if LARSEN is able to reproduce it or not.

The mixture is air11, 2 temperatures (T = Tr, Tv = Tel = Te).

If you find (small) mismatches with respect to the reference result figures, it may 
be due to a different version of the thermodinamic library that you are using 
(note: see [1]).

In the "mutation++_files" folder you can also find the "air11.xml" mixture file 
and the "parkair01.xml" reactions file that were used to run this simulation.


========== 
NOTES

[1] For example, seems like there is a wrong value in the air5 (and air11 maybe) 
    reaction mechanism file, not really matching the Park01 rates.
    This may still be the case in your implementation, or may not.
    If your new Mutation++ implementation still has this error, contact the 
    Mutation++ developers.
