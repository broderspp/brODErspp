To run the testcase, just run ./run_testcase.sh
This will call shockingpp a couple of folders above for the current testcase.

This testcase comes from a DSMC simulation of an (non-ionizing) argon flow over
a cylinder.
Larsen recomputes the temperature along a streamline. See a picture in this 
folder.

Since the mixture is composed of argon only, there are no chemical reactions and
all LARSEN does is recomputing the temperature.

####  Mixture

The mixture is an only-argon mixture "argon_only.xml". You can find it in this 
folder. Copy it in the data/mixtures directory of mutation++.

####  Simulation parameters:

Velocity: 2.609 km/s
Free stream number density: 8.606E+19
Temperature: 222 K
Knudsen number: 0.05

####  About the simulation

The simulation was performed with SPARTA, and literature results are also available, 
see Lofthouse (NONEQUILIBRIUM HYPERSONIC AEROTHERMODYNAMICS USING THE DIRECT 
SIMULATION MONTE CARLO AND NAVIER-STOKES MODELS, PhD dissertation).
