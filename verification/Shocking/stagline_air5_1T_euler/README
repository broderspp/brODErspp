This testcase compares the solution along the stagnation line of a sphere
(computed with the Stagline code) with the output of the current brODErs++ verion of 
Shocking++.

TO RUN THE TESTCASE, RUN THE SCRIPT: "./run_testcase"

The model used by stagline is inviscid (Euler): no heat or diffusive mass fluxes.
The numerical scheme is a time-implicit Roe.
The mixture is air5 in thermal equilibrium (T = Tr = Tv = Te).

The sphere has a 1m radius.

Freestream conditions are:
Press:                20.31 Pa
Translational Temp:   245.45 K
Velocity:             9000 m/s

The octave script automatically puts the Shocking output in correspondance of the shock
wave (by watching the rise in temperature).
