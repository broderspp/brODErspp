This testcase compares the solution along the stagnation line of a sphere
(computed with the Stagline code) with the output of the current brODErs++ verion of 
Shocking++.

TO RUN THE TESTCASE, RUN THE SCRIPT: "./run_testcase"

The model used by stagline is inviscid (Euler): no heat or diffusive mass fluxes.
The numerical scheme is a time-implicit Roe.
The mixture is air5 in thermal nonequilibrium (2 temperatures model: T = Tr, 
Tv = Tel = Te).

The sphere has a 1m radius.

Freestream conditions are:
Press:                20.31 Pa
Translational Temp:   245.45 K
Vibrational Temp:     245.45 K
Velocity:             9000 m/s

A good matching is seen in the shock region.
Then, the velocity after the shock departures in the stagnation line (2D axysimmetric) 
case, while for Shocking (1D solution) it reaches a plateau.
Accordingly, there is some difference in the temperature in the post-shock region.
In particular, the velocity decreases for the stagnation line case, thus the equilibrium
is reached more easily (more time for the temperatures to equilibrate) with respect
to the Shocking case, where the velocity reaches a given value.

The octave script automatically puts the Shocking output in correspondance of the shock
wave (by watching the rise in temperature).
