This testcase compares the result of the current brODErs++ version of Shocking
with some results from the old Shocking version by Panesi and with a result
by Johnston. Values were digitized from the Panesi PhD thesis.

The mixture is air11 with a two-temperature model (T,Tv): 
T = Tr, Tv = Tel = Te.

The flight conditions are relative to the 1634 s trajectory point of the 
FIRE-II capsule.

Free-stream conditions:
  2.0 Pa
  195 K
  11360 m/s

Results are pretty much off, but are reasonable at least.

MIND THAT:
- Panesi results use the (old) Mutation library and use different rates and
  transfer terms,
- Johnston results use different post-shock conditions for some reason (see the
  references).
