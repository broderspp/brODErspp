This directory contains some testcases that can be used to test LARSEN or Shocking.
Those testcases may be useful to quickly verify new implementations and modifications
of the codes.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!! PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT **ALL** TESTCASES WORK FINE BEFORE COMMITTING CHANGES ETC !!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

To run the testcase just get into the folder and run the script "run_<something>.sh"

The bash script automatically runs brODErs++, located in the bin directory just a few 
folders above.
The output is shown with Octave... so NEEDS OCTAVE TO BE INSTALLED.
Some plots are also saved to png images.

You can compare the output that you get with the "Reference_result_XXXX.png" images,
that show a result that I think is reasonable.
Some comparisons are given against the stagnation line code "Stagline", that uses a 
different implementation (of course) but is linked to the same library.
In case you are wondering, the Stagline simulations are well converged, the residuals 
being around 10^-4 (being started from 10^5).
The numerical scheme is Roe first order, implicit in time.
